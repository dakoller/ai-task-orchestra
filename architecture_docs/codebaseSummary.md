# AI Task Orchestra Codebase Summary

This document provides a concise overview of the AI Task Orchestra project structure and recent changes.

## Key Components and Their Interactions

### API Layer

- **main.py**: FastAPI application entry point
- **api/v1/router.py**: API router for v1 endpoints
- **api/v1/endpoints/tasks.py**: Endpoints for task management
- **api/v1/endpoints/templates.py**: Endpoints for template management

The API layer provides RESTful endpoints for creating and managing tasks and templates. It uses FastAPI for routing and request handling.

### Service Layer

- **services/task_service.py**: Service for task management
- **services/template_service.py**: Service for template management

The service layer contains the business logic for the application. It handles task creation, validation, and execution, as well as template loading and validation.

### Integration Layer

- **integrations/ollama.py**: Integration with Ollama for AI model inference

The integration layer provides interfaces to external services, such as Ollama for AI model inference.

### Worker Layer

- **worker.py**: Celery worker for task execution

The worker layer handles the execution of tasks. It uses Celery for distributed task processing.

### Configuration

- **config.py**: Application configuration

The configuration module handles loading and validating application settings from environment variables.

## Data Flow

1. A client sends a request to the API server to create a task.
2. The API server validates the task parameters against the template.
3. The API server enqueues the task in the task queue.
4. A worker picks up the task from the queue.
5. The worker executes the task according to the template.
6. The worker reports the task status and results back to the API server.
7. The client can query the API server for the task status and results.
