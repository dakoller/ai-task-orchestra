# AI Task Orchestra Architecture

## System Overview

AI Task Orchestra is a task scheduling and orchestration platform designed specifically for self-hosted AI workloads. It optimizes GPU usage, manages task dependencies, and automates complex AI workflows with intelligent resource management.

## Components

### API Server

The API server is the entry point for the system. It provides a RESTful API for creating and managing tasks. The API server is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.

Key responsibilities:
- Expose RESTful API endpoints
- Validate task parameters
- Enqueue tasks
- Provide task status and results

### Task Queue

The task queue is responsible for storing tasks until they can be executed. It is implemented using Redis and Celery. Redis is an in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. Celery is a distributed task queue system.

Key responsibilities:
- Store tasks in a priority queue
- Handle task dependencies
- Distribute tasks to workers

### Workers

Workers are responsible for executing tasks. They pull tasks from the queue and execute them according to the task template. Workers are implemented using Celery.

Key responsibilities:
- Execute tasks
- Report task status and results
- Handle task failures

### Templates

Templates define the steps to be executed for a task. They are stored as YAML files and loaded by the API server and workers.

Key responsibilities:
- Define task parameters
- Define task steps
- Provide parameter validation

### AI Models

AI models are used to perform inference and other AI operations. AI Task Orchestra integrates with Ollama, a self-hosted AI model server.

Key responsibilities:
- Load and manage AI models
- Perform inference
- Optimize resource usage

## Data Flow

1. A client sends a request to the API server to create a task.
2. The API server validates the task parameters against the template.
3. The API server enqueues the task in the task queue.
4. A worker picks up the task from the queue.
5. The worker executes the task according to the template.
6. The worker reports the task status and results back to the API server.
7. The client can query the API server for the task status and results.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Python**: Programming language
- **FastAPI**: Web framework
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue
- **Redis**: Message broker and result backend
- **SQLite**: Database (can be replaced with other databases)
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **YAML**: Template format

### AI Integration

- **Ollama**: Self-hosted AI model server
- **HTTPX**: HTTP client for API calls

### Deployment

- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration

## Future Enhancements

### Multi-Server Support

- Support for distributing tasks across multiple AI servers.
- Load balancing based on server capacity and model availability.

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

- Support for workflows that require human approval or input.
- Notification system for alerting users when their input is required.

### Advanced Plugins

- Plugin system for extending the functionality of the system.
- Custom task types beyond YAML templates.

### Team Collaboration

- User management and authentication.
- Shared workspaces and resource allocation.

### More AI Backends

- Support for additional AI backends such as LM Studio, llama.cpp, and Hugging Face.
- Integration with cloud AI services.
