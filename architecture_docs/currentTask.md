# Current Task: AI Task Orchestra Alpha Release

## Current Objectives

We are currently working on the Alpha Release (v0.1.0) of AI Task Orchestra. The focus is on implementing the core functionality and getting a basic working version of the system.

### In Progress

- **AI Integration**: Implementing model loading and management for Ollama integration
- **Resource Usage Optimization**: Optimizing GPU usage for AI model inference
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation for the project

### Next Steps

1. Complete the AI integration with model loading and management
2. Implement resource usage optimization
3. Finalize the documentation for the Alpha Release
4. Prepare for the Beta Release (v0.2.0)

## Context

AI Task Orchestra is a task scheduling and orchestration platform designed specifically for self-hosted AI workloads. It optimizes GPU usage, manages task dependencies, and automates complex AI workflows with intelligent resource management.

The project is structured as a FastAPI application with Celery for task execution and Redis for the task queue. It uses YAML templates to define task workflows and integrates with Ollama for AI model inference.

### Key Components

- **API Server**: FastAPI application for creating and managing tasks
- **Task Queue**: Redis and Celery for task scheduling and execution
- **Templates**: YAML files defining task workflows
- **AI Integration**: Ollama integration for AI model inference

### Recent Changes

- Implemented basic FastAPI application structure
- Added API endpoints for tasks and templates
- Implemented task creation and management
- Added template loading and validation
- Integrated Celery for task execution
- Integrated Redis for task queue
- Implemented basic task execution logic
- Added task status tracking and result storage
- Created YAML template format
- Implemented template parameter validation
- Added basic template steps
- Created built-in templates for common tasks
- Integrated Ollama for AI model inference
- Added Docker and Docker Compose configuration
- Implemented environment variable configuration
- Created basic documentation

## User Feedback

Users have provided the following feedback:

- The API is easy to use and intuitive
- The template system is flexible and powerful
- The Docker Compose setup makes it easy to get started
- More documentation is needed for advanced use cases
- More built-in templates would be helpful
- A web dashboard would be a nice addition

## Technical Considerations

### Performance

- The system should be able to handle a large number of tasks
- Task execution should be efficient and not waste resources
- AI model loading and unloading should be optimized

### Scalability

- The system should be able to scale horizontally
- Multiple workers should be able to process tasks in parallel
- The task queue should be able to handle a large number of tasks

### Security

- API authentication should be implemented
- Role-based access control should be considered
- Sensitive information should be properly secured

### Maintainability

- The code should be well-documented
- Tests should be comprehensive
- The architecture should be modular and extensible
